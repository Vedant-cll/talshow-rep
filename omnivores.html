    <body><h1>Omnivores</h1>
             
            <h3>The dinosaur world was filled with herbivore plant-eating dinosaurs and was estimated to be about 65%. There were also carnivore meat-eating dinosaurs, which made up about 35%. Additionally, there were omnivorous dinosaurs, which was a small percentage, about 1-2% of all dinosaurs. These dinosaurs could be called “opportunistic” eating dinosaurs. Omnivores are a class of dinosaurs that can simultaneously eat both plants and meat. They are arguably the easiest type to play due to food being very easy to come by. They have an almost perfect balance between health and attack power, the best of both worlds, mirroring their Diet. They tend to be loners, often sharing food with HerbivoreHerbivores, or scavenging from the corpses that the CarnivoreCarnivores leave behind, or even attempting to hunt if they feel brave enough and it's big enough. One example of an omnivore is the Ornithomimus, being the default. Larger omnivores like Gigantoraptor are capable of being formidable threats to even dedicated carnivores due to their eating habits allowing them to grow to adulthood at an accelerated rate.
