            <h3>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is not confirmed yet. Dinosaurs are the first reptiles.They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event.Dinosaurs can be divided into avian dinosaurs and non-avian dinosaurs, All non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago.There are roughly 700 known species of extinct dinosaurs. The word “dinosaur” was originally coined by a British paleontologist named Richard Owen in 1842, and came from the Greek words dienos (“terrible”) and sauros (“reptile”).Scientist believe that spinosaurus is the biggest meat eating dino.
                Birds are modern dinosaurs.Dinosaurs lay eggs. People found that out when they found egg fossils.Some dinosaurs have bone hard armor to protect them from meat eaters. Some dinosaurs eat insects instead of meat or plants.There are Dinosaurs that eat meat and plants or some dinosaur eat eggs.Some dinosaurs were carnivores (meat-eaters) but most were herbivores (plant-eaters).</h3>

            <h1>Herbivores</h1>
            <h3>Herbivores(plant eater dinosaurs) usually have blunt teeth that are good for stripping vegetation (leaves, twigs, etc.). Some also have flat teeth for grinding tough plant fibers. Many herbivores have cheek pouches in which they can store food for a while.Plant-eaters usually have larger digestive systems (than meat-eaters) that are needed to digest large amounts of tough plant fibers.Plant eaters eat stones to grind leaves.
                plant eating dinos have flat teeth that helps them chew the leaves and they have special stomach acid to help digest food.
                -some plant eating dinos swallow rocks that crush the plants.</h3>

            <h1>Carnivores</h1>
            <h3>Carnivorous dinosaurs usually had long, strong legs so that they could run quickly in order to catch their prey. They also needed large strong jaws, sharp teeth, and deadly claws so they could kill and then tear apart the prey. Good eyesight, a keen sense of smell, and a large brain to plan hunting strategies are also very important for successful hunting.Many of the carnivores (like Deinonychus, Coelophysis and Velociraptor) may have hunted in packs, so social cooperation was necessary for a good hunt for some species. Animals that are primarily scavengers (animals that eat meat that they did not kill themselves) need very sharp teeth and strong jaws for tearing into less than prime cuts of meat, and breaking bones to get the nutritious bone marrow.Most carnivores are scavengers when given the opportunity. Some dinosaurs were fish eaters, including Baryonyx and Suchomimus. Spinosaurus may have been a good swimmer (it had paddle-like feet similar to those of water birds). A few dinosaurs (including Coelophysis) have been found with small, fossilized animals within their fossil, giving information about their diet. Some dinosaurs may have even been cannibals, eating their own kind.

            <h1>Omnivores</h1>
            <h3>
                Only a few of the known dinosaurs were omnivores (eating both plants and animals). Some examples of omnivores are Ornithomimus and Oviraptor, which ate plants, eggs, insects, etc. Also, most herbivores are "accidental omnivores" because when they eat plants, they accidentally ingest many insects and other small animals.

                Gallimimus was a late ornithomimid dinosaur that ate by sieving tiny bits of food (like tiny crustaceans) from mud and waters in streams by using comb-like plates in its mouth.
