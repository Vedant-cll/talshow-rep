            <h1>Carnivores</h1><br>

        
        <h3>A carnivore is any animal that only eats the flesh of another animal. Carnivores need to eat lots of meat to survive, and to get this meat they need to be good hunters. Some of the methods that carnivores used to catch their prey are to chase their prey and tear it apart, Eat dead carcasses, also known as scavenging, Ambush their prey using their camouflage, Attack their prey in packs to bring it down and Cannibalism. Carnivore diets were very rich in nutrients from the flesh they ate, and they could easily go for weeks without food, unlike herbivores that needed to eat constantly. </h3>
