            <h1>Herbivores</h1><br>

        <h3>A herbivore is any animal that only feeds on plants. They are often prey for carnivores and omnivores. To counter this they have adapted various ways of either defending themselves, or escaping from the predator like they run away from the attacking predator,Hide from the predator using camouflage, Intimidate the predator with displays of colour/impressivenes, Use its own evolved body armour, Fight the predator off or Fly/swim away.</h3>
        
        <h3>Herbivores ate whatever vegetation they could find. Most herbivores were more suited to one particular type of vegetation, but some were not that fussy. Many herbivores, such as the sauropods, grew incredibly large because their diet of leaves and ferns required an enormous amount of digestion, and therefore required an exceedingly long intestine, which could only fit in large animals. The animals also swallowed stones, called gastroliths, that moved around in their stomach and helped grind the food down. This process created a lot of excess gas and most vegetation was quite rich in fibre, which made the dinosaurs produce lots of dung which is now fossilised as coprolites. This fossilised dung is now providing paleontologists with a detailed look at exactly what these dinosaurs ate.
